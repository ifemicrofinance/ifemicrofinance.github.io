          By joining a sales contract with Ife, your money will first be used to by farm capital to assist a farmer. The farmer will sell some of their harvested crops to us, and afterwards we will sell the crops back at a predetermined markup price. We store a portion of the produced crop and seed in order to hedge for the capital recipient farmer's losses. Another portion of the crop will be sold to non-lending partners, who need crop or seed to hedge for unexpected losses, and this partner will give a predetermined portion of sale back to us. This payment will be split between Ife and the farmer who initially received the capital. This process, however, can begin only with funds from donors, so we hope to be able to secure donations from you. This explicit relationship between donor and creditor is yet to be seen elsewhere, and Ife's commitment to long term growth and eco-friendliness makes us your best bet in micro lending. We hope you can invest in our cause.
